<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/897896186487390218/986285826189193267/unknown.png">
<h2> Installation </h2>
Click on the latest release <a href="https://github.com/MeblIkea/Landlords-Super-Mod-Manager/releases">(or here)</a>
<br>
Then click on <a href="https://github.com/MeblIkea/Water-Launcher/releases/latest/download/Water-Launcher.exe">Water.Launcher.exe</a> to download it.

Then, you can launch it.<br>
/!\ Windows can detect the new version as a virus (and I can't do anything about it :'( )

<h2> Setup </h2>
When you see the setup window, you have to enter your Landlord's Super directory (press "Default" if it's in the default Steam location)
<br>
<i>If it reads "This directory exist, and is Landlord's Super", then you can click "Set". Else, you will have to get the proper Landlord's Super location.</i>

<h2> Customisation </h2>
If you want to change the theme, you can click "Themes" > "Set themes".
<br>
Click "List themes" for see every theme you can have, then keep the name of your theme in mind. 
<br>
Close the list themes window, and put the name of your theme in the input.
<br>
Click "set themes", close and re-open the software, and it should be all good.

<h2> Installing the main mod </h2>
<i> For every mods can work, you have to install a <a href="https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx"> main mod </a> (it's automatically installed).</i>
  
  (more information under 
  [Moojuiceman's repo](https://github.com/Moojuiceman-LSMods))</i>
</br>
You just have to click "Install" on the main tab, and you are good to go.

<h2> Installing a mod </h2>
Click "Browse mods", and then, you can see every mod for Landlord's Super, and you read their descriptions, and install them.
